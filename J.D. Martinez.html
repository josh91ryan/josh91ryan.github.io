<p> > J.D Martinez for much of his career was a journey man in the MLB and could not find a
    home with any team and he was not all that good ethier.</p>

<p> > However Martinez had a career year last season with the Diamondbakcs and was signed by
    the red sox in the offseason and has been the redsox best hitter and has grown into
    a great leader for the young players on the team.</p>

<p> > The edition of Martinez has put the Red sox at the top of the league and on there
    way to first place in there division, and hopefully a long productive play-off run.</p>
